# Surviving the JSON Jungle

## Getting started

Ensure you have [uv][uv-install-docs] installed.

Once that's done, you can set up the project with:

```bash
make setup
```

Run the Polars script.

```bash
make run-polars
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add DuckDB processing scripts.
- [ ] Refine transformations, keeping only what's necessary.
- [ ] Look into query plans?
- [ ] Add some testing for better checks that the transformations work well.
